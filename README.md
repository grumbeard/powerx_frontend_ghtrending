## About this App

This app utilizes the following APIs listed on `public-apis/public-apis`:
- Trending-Github: https://docs.trending-github.com/
- GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest

As no official GitHub API exists publishing data about 'Trending Repositories on GitHub' typically available at https://github.com/trending, this app obtains that data from [Trending-Github](https://docs.trending-github.com/).


>### **NOTE**: 
>
>Not all data from Trending-Github is available with accuracy (as of 7 Oct 2021)
>- Route `/github/spoken-languages`: 200 OK
>- Route `/github/languages`: 200 OK
>- Route `/github/repositories`: 200 OK
>  - [optional] Query "period":
>    - `daily` - 200 OK
>    - `weekly` - 200 OK but Inaccurate (shows `daily` data)
>    - `monthly` - 200 OK but Inaccurate (shows `daily` data)
>  - [optional] Query "language": 200 OK
>  - [optional] Query "spokenLanguage": 200 OK
  
When viewing the Details page of any repository, data is pulled from the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest) which is more comprehensive.
